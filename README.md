## WARNING

On 0.1.1 version, the transaction fee applied 0.13% of the trade amount, and the internal policy has decided to not open blocks' mining. Due to this reason, the mining reward no longer provided, and on the later version 2.0.0, the reward can be provided by numbers of processed transaction verifications after selecting an option of agreeing to utilize transaction verification nodes. The rate of rewards are now coordinating and it will be noticed after the policy determined.
